PG_PROFILE_IMAGE


 PURPOSE:
	Generates a dn profile along a line in an image.

 CATEGORY:
	NV/PG


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
    result = pg_profile_image(dd, cd=cd, outline_ps)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	  dd:	Data descriptor.

 outline_ps:   pg_points_struct giving the outline of the region to plot,
               as produced by the pg_image_sector.

  OUTPUT:
        NONE

 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
	  cd:	Camera descriptor.  Needed for sinc interpolation. (to get PSF)

         gd:   Optional generic descriptor containing cd.

     interp:   Type of interpolation to use.  Options are:
               'nearest', 'mean', 'bilinear', 'cubic', 'sinc'.

         bg:	Uniform value to subtract from profile.

 arg_interp:   Arguments to pass to the interpolation function.


  OUTPUT:
    profile:   The profile.

      sigma:   Array giving the standard deviation at each point in the
		profile.

    distance:  Array giving the distance, in pixels, along the profile.

   image_pts:  Image point for each point along the profile.


 RETURN:
	Two data descriptors: the first contains the profile; the second contains
	the profile sigma.
