 PURPOSE:
	Calculates an arctan edge model for use in curve fitting.

 CATEGORY:

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       result = edge_model_atan(n, w)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	    n:	Size of the model in samples

	    a:	Scaling factor: larger values give a sharper edge.

  OUTPUT:
	 zero:  The array element corresponding to the physical edge.

	delta:	The number of pixels represented by each element
		Currently = 1.0

	cd:	Not used.


 RETURN:
	An array containing the model.
