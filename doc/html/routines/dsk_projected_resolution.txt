DSK_PROJECTED_RESOLUTION


 PURPOSE:
	Computes the resolution (actually scale) components at a point on a 
	disk in a given camera.


 CATEGORY:
       NV/LIB/TOOLS


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       res = dsk_projected_resolution(dkx, cd, p, scale)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	dkx:	Any subclass of DISK.

	cd:	Camera descriptor.

	p:	Point on the dkx in inertial coordinates.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT: NONE

  OUTPUT: 
	rad:	Pixel scale in the radial direction.

	lon:	Pixel scale in the longitude direction.

	perp:	Pixel scale in the direction perpendicular to the 
		projected longitude direction.
	
	rr:	Intercept radius.


 RETURN: 
	Radial resolution on dkx at r, computed as the length of a
	segment bisecting the intersection ellipse in the radial direction.
