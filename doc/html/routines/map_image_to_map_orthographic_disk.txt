MAP_IMAGE_TO_MAP_ORTHOGRAPHIC_DISK


 PURPOSE:
	Transforms the given image points to map coordinate points
	using an orthographic projection for a disk.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/LIB/MAP


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	map_pts = map_image_to_map_orthographic_disk(md, image_pts)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT: 
	md	 	Array (nt) of MAP descriptors.

	image_pts:	Array (2,nv,nt) of map image points.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT: NONE

  OUTPUT: 
	valid:	Indices of all input points that correspond to valid
		output map points.  If not set then all points are
		valid.


 RETURN:
	Array (2,nv,nt) of map coordinate points in an orthographic disk 
	projection.  This projection portrays a disk as seen from a
	great distance.  Scale is uniform, but it is only true if the
	projection is polar.  Likewise, areas are distorted for non-polar
	projections.


 STATUS:
	Complete
