IMAGE_INTERP_CAM


 PURPOSE:
       Extracts a region from an image using the desired interpolation,
	accouting for the camera point-spread function is applicable.


 CATEGORY:
       NV/LIB/TOOLS


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       result = image_interp_cam(image, grid_x, grid_y, args)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	image:	An array of image point arrays.

	grid_x:	The grid of x positions for interpolation

	grid_y:	The grid of y positions for interpolation

	args:	Arguments to pass to the interpolation function.

  OUTPUT:  NONE


 KEYOWRDS:
  INPUT: 
	cd:	Camera descriptor.

	interp:	Type of interpolation to use.  Options are:
		'nearest', 'mean', 'bilinear', 'cubic', 'sinc'.

	k:	"Half-width" of the convolution window.  The
		window actually covers the central pixel, plus
		k pixel in each direction.  Default is 3, which
		gives a 7x7 window.

	kmax:	Maximum value for k.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 RETURN:
       Array of interpolated points at the (grid_x, grid_y) points.
