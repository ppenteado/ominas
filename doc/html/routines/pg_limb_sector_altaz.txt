PG_LIMB_SECTOR_ALTAZ

 PURPOSE:
	Constructs a limb sector outline for use with pg_profile_ring given
	altitude and azimuth bounds.
 
 CATEGORY:
       NV/PG

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
     outline_ps=pg_limb_sector_altaz(cd=cd, gbx=gbx, alt, az, dkd=dkd)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
      alt:	2-elements array giving the lower and upper altitude bounds
		for the sector.

      az:	2-elements array giving the lower and upper azimuth bounds
		for the sector in radians, reliative to the skyplane 
		projection of the planet's north pole.

  OUTPUT:
	NONE



 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT: 
           cd:     Camera descriptor.

          gbx:     Globe descriptor giving the planet about whose limb
                   the scan will be extracted.

           gd:     Generic descriptor containing the above descriptors.

       sample:     Sets the grid sampling in pixels.  Default is one.

          naz:     Total number of samples in the azimuthal direction.  
                   Determined by the 'sample' keyword by default.

         nalt:     Total number of samples in the altitude direction.  
                   Determined by the 'sample' keyword by default.

          alt:     Array giving the altitude of each point in the sector.

           az:     Array giving the azimuth of each point in the sector.

           cw:     If set, azimuths are assumed to increase in the clockwise
                   direction.

        nodsk:     If set, skyplane disk image points will not be included 
                   in the output pg_points_struct.

      graphic:     If set, the sector is computed in the planetographic
                   sense, i.e., lines of constant azimuth extend along 
                   the local surface normal direction instead of the radial
                   direction.


  OUTPUT:
          dkd:     Disk descriptor in the skyplane, centered on the planet
                   with 0 axis along the skyplane projection of the north 
                   pole.  For use with pg_profile_ring.

         azimuths: Array giving azimuth at each sample.

        altitudes: Array giving altitude at each sample.

    limb_pts_body: Body coordinates of each limb points on planet surface.



 RETURN: 
      pg_points_struct containing points on the sector outline.  The point
      spacing is determined by the sample keyword.  The points structure
      also contains the disk coordinate for each point, relative to the
      returned disk descriptor, and the user fields 'nrad' and 'nlon' 
      giving the number of points in altitude and azimuth.
