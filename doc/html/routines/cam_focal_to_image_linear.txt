CAM_FOCAL_TO_IMAGE_LINEAR


 PURPOSE:
       Transforms the given array of points in the focal plane
       coordinate system to an array of points in the image
       coordinate system using a linear model that assumes that
       distances in the image are proportional to angles in the focal
       plane.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/LIB/CAM
