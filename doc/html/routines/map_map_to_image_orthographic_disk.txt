MAP_MAP_TO_IMAGE_ORTHOGRAPHIC_DISK


 PURPOSE:
	Transforms the given map points to map image points using the 
	orthographic projection on a disk.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/LIB/MAP


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	image_pts = map_map_to_image_orthographic_disk(md, map_pts)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT: 
	md	 	Array (nt) of MAP descriptors.

	map_pts:	Array (2,nv,nt) of map points.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT: NONE

  OUTPUT: 
	valid:	Indices of all input points that correspond to valid
		output image points.  If not se then all points are
		valid.


 RETURN:
	Array (2,nv,nt) of map image points in an orthographic disk 
	projection.  This projection portrays a disk as seen from a
	great distance.  Scale is uniform, but it is only true if the
	projection is polar.  Likewise, areas are distorted for non-polar
	projections.


 STATUS:
	Complete
