ICV_SCAN_STRIP_HALF


 PURPOSE:
	At each point along an image strip, finds a sharp edge using the
	half-power method.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/LIB/TOOLS/ICV


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	result = icv_scan_strip_half(strip, model, szero, mzero)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	strip:	Image strip (n_points,ns) to be scanned.  Output from
		icv_strip_curve ns must be even.

	model:	Not used.

	szero:	Zero-offset position in the strip.

	mzero:	Not used.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT: NONE

  OUTPUT:
	cc:	Not used, hardwired to 0.9999999d.

	sigma:	Offset uncertainty for each point on the curve, computed as
		one half of the half-width of the half-power peak. 


 RETURN:
	Offset of half-power points at each point on the curve.


 STATUS:
	Complete.
