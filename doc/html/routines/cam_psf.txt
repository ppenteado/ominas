CAM_PSF


 PURPOSE:
	Computes a point-spread function.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/LIB/CAM


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	psf = cam_psf(cd, x, y)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	cd:	 Camera descriptor.

	x:	 Array of x coordinates relative to the center of the PSF,
		 or a width in the x direction.

	y:	 Array of y coordinates relative to the center of the PSF,
		 or a width in the y direction.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:  NONE

  OUTPUT: NONE


 RETURN:
	Point-spread function values at each point specified by the x and y 
	arguments.


 PROCEDURE:
	The function indicated by the fn_psf field of the camera descriptor
	is called and its return value is passed through to the caller of
	cam_psf.  If x and y widths are given instead of arrays, the PSF
	will be centered, and the grid spacing will be one pixel.
