MAP_MAP_TO_IMAGE_STEREOGRAPHIC


 PURPOSE:
	Transforms the given map points to map image points using the 
	stereographic projection.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/LIB/MAP


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	image_pts = map_map_to_image_stereographic(md, map_pts)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT: 
	md	 	Array (nt) of MAP descriptors.

	map_pts:	Array (2,nv,nt) of map points.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT: 
	nowrap:	If set, then points that lie outide the map will not be
		around to the other side.

  OUTPUT: 
	valid:	Indices of all input points that correspond to valid
		output image points.  If not se then all points are
		valid.


 RETURN:
	Array (2,nv,nt) of map image points in an stereographic 
	projection.  This projection results from the projection through
	a sphere onto a plane, from a point on the surface of the sphere.
	Scale is true only at the map center.  Areas are distorted, 
	especially away from the map center.  

	With:

	  a = [size[0],size[1]]/4 * scale,

	and:

	  e = sqrt(1 - (A/(B+C)/2)^2),

	where A, B, and C are the triaxial ellipsoid radii, and:

	  lat0 = lat / units[0]

	  lon0 = lon / units[1]

	  m1 = cos(center[0]]) / sqrt(1 - e^2*sin(center[0])^2)

	  X = 2*atan(tan(pi/4 + lat/2) * $
	       ((1 - e*sin(lat0))/(1 + e*sin(lat0)))^(e/2)) - pi/2

	  X1 = 2*atan(tan(pi/4 + center[0]/2) * 
	       ((1 - e*sin(center[0]))/(1 + e*sin(center[0])))^(e/2)) - pi/2d
 
	  A = 2*a*scale*m1 / 
	   ( cos(X1)*(1 + sin(X1)*sin(X) + cos(X1)*cos(X)*cos(lon0 - center[1])) )

	the transformation is:

	  x = A * cos(X)*sin(lon0 - center[1]) + origin[0]

	  y = A * ( cos(X1)*sin(X) - sin(X1)*cos(X)*sin(lon0 - center[1]) ) + 
	                                                              origin[1]

	See [1], p. 160 for the mathematical derivation.
