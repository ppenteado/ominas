CAMERA_DESCRIPTOR__DEFINE


 PURPOSE:
	Class structure fo the CAMERA class.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/LIB/CAM


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	N/A 


 FIELDS:
	bd:	BODY class descriptor.  

		Methods: cam_body, cam_set_body


	scale:	2-element array giving the camera scale (radians/pixel) in 
		each direction.  The meaning of this quantity depends on the
		distortion model.

		Methods: cam_scale, cam_set_scale


	oaxis:	2-element array giving the image coordinates corresponding 
		to the camera optic axis.

		Methods: cam_oaxis, cam_set_oaxis


	exposure:	Exposure duration.  BODY time refers to the 
			center of this interval.

			Methods: cam_exposure, cam_set_exposure


	size:	Image size in pixels.

		Methods: cam_size, cam_set_size

	filters:	String array giving the names of each filter.


	fn_focal_to_image:	String giving the name of a function
				that transforms points in the focal
				plane coordinate system to points in 
				the image coordinate system.  Default is
				cam_image_to_focal_linear().

				Methods: cam_fn_focal_to_image, 
				         cam_set_fn_focal_to_image


	fn_image_to_focal:	String giving the name of a function
				that transforms points in the image
				coordinate system to points in the focal-
				plane coordinate system.  Default is
				cam_image_to_focal_linear().

				Methods: cam_fn_image_to_focal 
				         cam_set_fn_image_to_focal


	fn_data_p:	Pointer to generic data intended to be used by 
			the above user-defined focal <--> image functions. 


	fn_psf:	String giving the name of a function to be defined as 
		follows:

		function <name>, cd, x, y, default=default

		The function should return an array of PSF values at the given 
		coordinates, subject to the following rules:

		1) If neither x nor y are given, then a PSF function is returned
		   on some default grid, which is application-specific.

		2) If only x is given, then PSF values are returned for each x, 
		   with y values set to zero.

		3) If x and y are given, then PSF values are returned at all 
		   points (x,y).


		Methods: cam_fn_psf, cam_set_fn_psf, cam_psf, cam_psf_attrib
