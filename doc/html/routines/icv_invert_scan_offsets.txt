ICV_INVERT_SCAN_OFFSETS


 PURPOSE:
	Uses scan image coordinates to produce scan offsets and angles.  This
	routine is the reverse of icv_convert_scan_offsets.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/LIB/TOOLS/ICV


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	result = icv_invert_scan_offsets(curve_pts, scan_pts, $
	                                       cos_alpha, sin_alpha)

 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	curve_pts:	Array (2, n_points) of image points making up the curve.

	scan_pts:	Array (2, n_points) of image coordinates corresponding to each scan
			offset.

	cos_alpha:	Array (n_points) of direction cosines.

	sin_alpha:	Array (n_points) of direction sines.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 KEYWORDS: NONE


 RETURN:
	Array (2, n_points) of image coordinates corresponding to each scan
	offset.


 STATUS:
	Complete.
