PG_PROFILE_RING


 PURPOSE:
	Generates radial or longitudinal ring profiles from the given image
	using an image outline.

 CATEGORY:
	NV/PG


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
    result = pg_profile_ring(dd, cd=cd, dkx=dkx, gbx=gbx, outline_ps)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	dd:	Data descriptor.

       outline_ps:    pg_points_struct giving the outline of the sector to plot,
                      as produced by the pg_ring_sector.

  OUTPUT:
        NONE

 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
	  cd:	Camera descriptor.

        dkx:   Disk descriptor.

	 gbx:   Array  of descriptors of objects which must be a subclass 
               of GLOBE, describing the primary body for dkx.  For each
               timestep, only the first descriptor is used.

         gd:   Generic descriptor, if used, cd and dkx taken from it unless
               overriden by cd and dkx arguments.

  azimuthal:   If set, the plot is longitudinal instead of radial.

       bin:    If set, pixels in sector are binned according to
               radius or longitude rather than dn averaged at equal
               radius or longitude spacing

    interp:    Type of interpolation to use: 'nearest', 'bilinear', 'cubic',
               or 'sinc'.  'sinc' is the default.

         bg:	Uniform value to subtract from profile.

 arg_interp:   Arguments to pass to the interpolation function.

   frame_bd:   Subclass of BODY giving the frame against which to 
               measure inclinations and nodes, e.g., a planet 
               descriptor.  One per bx.

    anomaly:   If set, longitudes in outline_ps are interpreted instead
               as anomalies.

  OUTPUT:
    profile:   The profile.

    dsk_pts:	Array of disk coordinates corresponding to each value in the
		returned dn profile.

    im_pts:	Array of image coordinates corresponding to each value in the
		returned dn profile.

      sigma:   Array giving the standard deviation at each point in the
		profile.

      width:   Array giving the width of the scan, in pixels along the 
               averaging direction, at each point in the profile.

         nn:   Number of image samples averaged into each profile point.

 RETURN:
	Two data descriptors: the first contains the profile; the second contains
	the profile sigma.


 PROCEDURE:
	The image points of the sector outline are first calculated.  If 
       /outline is selected then this is output.  If not, then the
       /azimuthal keyword determines if this is a radius or longitude 
       profile.  The radius and longitude spacing for profile is then is 
       determined. If n_lon or n_rad is given, then these are used.  If not,
       then the outline is used to determine the spacing in radius and
       longitude so that the maximum spacing is a pixel.  If oversamp is
       given then the number of samples is multiplied by this factor.
       Then the image is sampled with this radius x longitude grid and
       the dn interpolated with the routine image_interp at each point.
       The dn's are then averaged along the requested profile direction.
       If /bin keyword is selected then the image is not interpolated but
       rather each pixel is binned in a histogram with the calculated
       spacing.


 EXAMPLE:
     lon = [175.,177.]
     rad = [65000000.,138000000.]
     outline_ps = pg_ring_sector(cd=cd, dkx=rd, gbx=pd, rad=rad, lon=lon)
     pg_draw, outline_ps

     profile = pg_profile_ring(dd, cd=cd, dkx=rd, gbx=pd, $
                                          outline_ps, dsk_pts=dsk_pts)
     window, /free, xs=500, ys=300
     plot, dsk_pts[*,0], profile
