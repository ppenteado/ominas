PG_COVARIANCE


 PURPOSE:
	Computes a covariance matrix for the least-square fit specified by the
	input scan coefficients.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/PG


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	dxy = pg_covariance(cf)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	cf:	Array of pg_fit_coeff_struct as produced by pg_cvscan_coeff or
		pg_ptscan_coeff.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT: NONE

  OUTPUT:
	status:	0 if successful, -1 otherwise.


 RETURN:
	Covariance matrix.  The diagonal elements are the variances in each fit
	parameter, the off-diagonal elements are the covariances.


 RESTRICTIONS:
	It is the caller's responsibility to ensure that all of the input
	coefficients were computed using with the same set of fixed parameters.


 STATUS:
	Complete
