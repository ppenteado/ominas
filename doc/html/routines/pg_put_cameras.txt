PG_PUT_CAMERAS


 PURPOSE:
	Outputs camera descriptors through the translators.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/PG


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	pg_put_cameras, dd, cd=cd
	pg_put_cameras, dd, gd=gd


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	dd:	Data descriptor.

	trs:	String containing keywords and values to be passed directly
		to the translators as if they appeared as arguments in the
		translators table.  These arguments are passed to every
		translator called, so the user should be aware of possible
		conflicts.  Keywords passed using this mechanism take 
		precedence over keywords appearing in the translators table.

  OUTPUT:
	NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
	cds:	Camera descriptors to output.

	gd:	Generic descriptor.  If present, camera descriptors are
		taken from the gd.cd field.

	cam_*:		All camera override keywords are accepted.

	tr_override:	String giving a comma-separated list of translators
			to use instead of those in the translators table.  If
			this keyword is specified, no translators from the 
			table are called, but the translators keywords
			from the table are still used.  

  OUTPUT:
	NONE


 SIDE EFFECTS:
	Translator-dependent.  The data descriptor may be affected.


 PROCEDURE:
	Camera descriptors are passed to the translators.  Any camera
	keywords are used to override the corresponding quantities in the
	output descriptors.


 STATUS:
	Complete
