GLOBE Object Class
==================

 The GLOBE object class describes the shapes of planet-like objects.  
 Currently, it describes a triaxial ellipsoid, but this may be generalized 
 in the future.  It is an immediate subclass of SOLID.


Coordinate systems
------------------
 - Inertial
	Cartesian coordinate system used as the celestial reference frame.

 - Body
	Cartesian coordinate system centered on and fixed to the body.  This
	coordinate system is inherited from BODY.

 - Globe
	Rotating spherical coordinate system defined with respect to the 
	surface of the body.  Vectors are given as [planetocentric latitude,
	east planetocentric longitude, altitude from local radius].  The 
	prime meridian is defined by the b0 body axis (see diagram below).  
	This longitude reference is not constrained by the glb package.  The 
	'lref' field in the globe descriptor can be used to identify the 
	particular longitude system so that other programs can perform 
	conversions among longitude systems if desired.

 - Graphic
	Analogous to the globe coordinate system except that latitudes
	and longtudes are planetographic.

 - Local
	Rotating cartesian coordinate system defined by a point on the 
	surface of a globe.  Axis 0 points toward local east, axis 1 
	toward local north, and axis 2 toward local zenith.

 - Altaz
	Rotatng spherical representation of the local coordinate system.
	Component 0 is the elevation of a vector from local horiontal, 
	component 1 is the azimuth of the vector from local north, increasing
	westward, and component 2 is the lemgth of the vector.


Data objects
------------
 - orientation matrix
	The orientation matrix is inherited from BODY.  The b2 axis corresponds
	to latitude=pi/2 and the b0 axis corresponds to longitude=0, as shown.


				 b2 --> latitude = pi/2
				| 
				|  / b1
				| /
				|/
				 ------- b0 --> longitude = 0
			


 - position vector
	The position vector is inherited from BODY.  It gives the position of
	the body center with respect to the inertial coordinate system.


 - globe descriptor
	The globe descriptor is the class structure for the GLOBE class.  
	See globe_descriptor__define.
