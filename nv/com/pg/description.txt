PG User Interface to OMINAS
===========================
 PG is a user interface to OMINAS that is based around the IDL command line.  It 
 is intended as a low-level, command-based interface providing the greatest 
 amount of flexibility at the expense of some amount of user-friendliness.  As 
 such, it is ideal as a basis for processing data in batch mode.  Most PG 
 commands are little more than wrappers for lower level routines, their 
 primary purpose being to package the inputs and outputs in a consistent form.  


Structure of a PG Program
-------------------------
 The following example illustrates the organization of a typical PG program
 that computes image points.  See any of the existing PG programs for further
 examples.

                          desc=desc, $
                          gd={gbx:gbx[i], cd:cd[0]}, $
                          assoc_xd = gbx[i], $
                          points = points, $
                          flags = flags, $
                          vectors = inertial_pts)	; store the result
  end


 return, result_ptd
end
;=============================================================================


 The arguments to this program consist of one or more object descriptors (in this
 case GLOBEs), a camera descriptor, and a 'generic descriptor'.  By convention, 
 these arguments appear as keywords in the argument list.  The program file is 
 prepended by a documentation header, which can be parsed and included in the
 OMINAS documentation.  

 Descriptor Arguments

  By convention, a PG program like the above accepts an array of object
  descriptors (planet, star, or whatever) and performs its operation
  on each one, producing an output array for each input object.  In this
  example, the object descriptor argument is gbx, meaning a descriptor of any
  subclass of GLOBE.  Naming conventions for other descriptor arguments are 
  discussed below.  The output of the above program is an array of 
  POINT objets (see below), one for each given object descriptor (gbx in 
  this example).  The array of image points associated with each POINT 
  will have dimensions (2,nv,nt), and the inertial vectors (if there are any) 
  will have dimensions (nv,3,nt), where nv is the number of vectors or points 
  and nt is the number of timesteps (see the object library description for 
  more detail).  

  For some PG programs, there may be additional object descriptor arguments. 
  For example, PG_LIMB accepts an argument describing the object whose 
  limb is being computed as well as an argument describing the observer
  with respect to which the limb is being computed.  Note that for purposes
  of computing the result, the observer is not in general the same as the
  camera, although that is the default.  If, for example, a star descriptor is
  given as the observer argument, then the result is a terminator.  This
  multi-application ability is highly desirable and is a by-product of the 
  object-oriented structure of the OMINAS object library. 

  It is conventional for a PG program of this type to accept a single camera
  descriptor, which describes the transformations necessary to compute image
  points.  In many PG programs, a map descriptor may be given instead of
  a camera descriptor, causing map image coordinates to be used instead of
  camera image coordinates.  This is not always appropriate, but in cases where
  it is, the distinction is handled in the object library, generally by a
  routine in the composite sublibrary, since it is not considered to be a
  user-interface issue.  This organization makes it easier to add other
  types of imaging descriptors in the future without altering the PG code.


 Generic Descriptor

  All PG programs that accept object descriptors as arguments also accept a
  structure called a generic descriptor.  A generic descriptor is a structure
  that contains (at least) all of the descriptor arguments to a particular
  program.  For example, the above program expects the generic descriptor to
  contain a camera descriptor field (cd) and a globe descriptor field (gbx). 
  The program does not care about any other fields that might be contained in
  the generic descriptor.  The descriptor keywords are used only if no generic
  descriptor is given, or if a particular descriptor is not present in the
  generic descriptor.  The generic descriptor is usefu for reduceing the number 
  of parameters to each program when calling from the command line.  

  The generic descriptor is also a means for storing all of the geometry 
  describing a scene.  The PG_GET_* programs each add their descriptors to the
  generic descriptor stored in the data descriptor, so the scene information 
  is always available.  The data descriptor is also added to the generic 
  descriptor in each geometry descriptor.

  Finally, the generic descriptor provides a means for associating a set of 
  descriptors with a given data set.  For example, when multiple data descriptors
  are input to PG_GET_CAMERAS, there is no constraint on the ordering of the
  output camera descriptors.  Those output descriptors may be matched to their
  corresponding data descritors by looking at their generic dscriptors.


 Descriptor Naming Conventions

  The following naming convention is used for descriptor arguments to all
  PG programs, as well as generic descriptor tag names:

	gd   :	Generic descriptor.
	dd   :	DATA descriptor.
	ptd  :	POINT descriptor.
	od   : 	Observer descriptor.
	cd   :	CAMERA descriptor.  Some programs which accept a camera
		descriptor will also accept a map descriptor for this argument.
	md   :	MAP descriptor.
	pd   :	PLANET descriptor.
	rd   :	RING descriptor.
	sd   :	STAR descriptor.
	bd   :	BODY descriptor.
	sld  :	SOLID descriptor.
	gbd  :	GLOBE descriptor.
	dkd  :	DISK descriptor.
	crd  :	CORE descriptor.
	std  :	STATION descriptor.
	ard  :	ARRAY descriptor.
	sund :	STAR descriptor for the sun or other illumination source.
	xd   :	Arbitrary descriptor (note sme older programs use 'od' ("object
		descriptor") this purpose.  These should be changed to 'xd'.

  For arbitrary subclasses, the 'd' is replaced with 'x'; e.g., 'bx' refers
  to any sublass BODY.


Display Issues
--------------
 The most basic way of displaying images in OMINAS is to use the TVIM program, 
 which is supplied as part of the utilities package.  TVIM displays images 
 using IDL's TVSCL routine, but it additionally maintains a data coordinate 
 system that allows points arrays (i.e., 2 x nv xnt arrays) to be plotted 
 correctly using PLOTS.  PG also provides a program, PG_DRAW, that displays 
 either point arrays or POINT objects.  Images and plots ma also be displayed 
 and manipulated using GRIM, the graphical interface to ominas.  
 

Manipulating Object Descriptors
-------------------------------
 PG provides routines for obtaining various objects from the object library. 
 The routines are named PG_GET_<class>s, where <class> is the name of the object 
 class.  For example, PG_GET_CAMERAS obtains camera descriptors.  These routines 
 allow all or some the of fields of the object descriptor to be overridden. 
 Parameters that are not overridden are obtained via the translators using
 DAT_GET_VALUE.  Similarly, PG provides routines named PG_SET_<class>s, to output
 object descriptors through the translators using DAT_SET_VALUE.  

 The PG_GET/SET programs are the means by which the PG library isolates data
 analysis code from geometry sources via the DAT_GET/SET_VALUE mechanism, which
 was the foremost motivation for bothering to write OMINAS.  Therefore, the user 
 should ALWAYS, NO EXCEPTIONS use these routines to obtain geometry descriptors.  
 To obtain data from a new source (say, a new star catalog), you should write a 
 translator for that source and put its name in the translators table 
 (see dat/description.txt).
