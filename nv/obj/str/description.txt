STAR Object Class
=================

 The STAR object class describes stellar objects.  It is an immediate subclass 
 of GLOBE.


Coordinate systems
------------------
 - Inertial
	Cartesian coordinate system used as the celestial reference frame.

 - Body
	Rotating cartesian coordinate system centered on and fixed to the body.
	This coordinate system is inherited from BODY.  Most stars will not have
	body coordinate information.

 - globe
	Rotating spherical coordinate system defined with respect to the 
	surface of the star.  This coordinate system is inherited from GLOBE.
	Most stars will not have surface coordinate information.


Data objects
------------
 - orientation matrix
	The orientation matrix is inherited from BODY.  Th b2 axis corresponds
	to the normal to the rotation axis and the b0 axis gives the zero
	direction of longitude as shown.  This is usually a unitary matrix.

				| b2 --> rotation axis, latitude = pi/2
				|
				|
				|_______
			       /        b1
			      /
			     / b0 --> longitude = 0


 -  position vector
	The position vector is inherited from BODY.  It gives the position of
	the star center with respect to the inertial coordinate system.


 - star descriptor
	The star descriptor is the class structure for the STAR class.  
	See star_descriptor__define.
